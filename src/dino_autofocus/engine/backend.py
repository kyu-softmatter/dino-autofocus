"""What the engine needs from a microscope: the Backend protocol and its plain records.

Implementations live in `engine/backends/` (mock, replay, mm-demo, mm-real). Rules every
implementation follows:

- z is always in bench coordinates (ZDrive um, increasing = toward the sample, sample
  window 2800-3200). A device with another origin (the Micro-Manager demo Z) offsets
  inside the backend; guards and records never see its own numbers.
- Every write returns a `Readback`: what was wanted, what was read afterwards, verified.
- Light is set through meaning-level methods, not property writes, so a device with no
  `State` property (the demo LED shutter) is covered. Aura percent is converted to the
  device's per-mille inside the backend (1 % -> GREEN_Intensity 10).
- A position read that fails is a field (`Positions.errors`), never an exception: a
  missing stage must not stop the camera.
- The backend does not judge safety. Motion methods take the guards' `MotionToken` and
  call `require_token` first, so only `engine.guards` can move the stage or focus. Light
  methods that switch on or change intensity take it too (PLAN D15); switching off never does.
- `set_property` is an allow-list (`check_set_property`): motion devices are always refused,
  light properties need the token, a short list of camera properties needs none, and
  everything else is refused. Every backend calls it before writing.
- Markings such as "unmeasured provisional" or a demo substitution go into `notes`, never
  into device or property names.
