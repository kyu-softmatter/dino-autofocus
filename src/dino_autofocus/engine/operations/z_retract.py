"""`z_retract{}`: ZDrive to z_safe (0 um), the first engine motion on the stand (T-039).

Runbook step 2a (docs/runbooks/first-bench-motion.md): away from the sample, the safest
direction, so it tests the lock lift, the readback and the records before any XY move.

- Moves through `FocusAxis.retract()` (engine/guards.py): descend only, read back within the
  guards' Z tolerance; a mismatch fails the operation with the commanded and read values.
  Already at z_safe: succeeds with no move and records the readback.
- PFS first, as the F5 order, scripts/change_objective.py and objective_change do: driving
  ZDrive while PFS is engaged fights the focus lock (PFS was on in the 2026-09-30 session).
  Preflight refuses an unreadable PFS; the run switches PFS off (`require_pfs_quiet`,
  disable only, never enable) before the move and records the PFS state after it.
- Refuses only what every motion refuses: the T-036 lock (mm-real reports
  `notes["bench_motion"]` as "LOCKED: ..." and its move_z raises as well) and rule 12
  (control plus an open session; the runner's permission table, motion class by default).
  No clearance callback is needed: it moves away from the sample.
- `motion = False` in the runner's sense: it is not refused while a sample awaits return,
  since retracting is always the safe move.
- Lights: nothing is switched; the runner's exit path keeps its own rule (T-011e).
