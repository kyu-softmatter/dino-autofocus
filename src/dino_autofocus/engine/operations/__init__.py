"""Engine operations (WP-C, WP-H, WP-I). Importing this package registers every operation with
the runner's registry (`engine.runner.OPERATIONS`), because each module registers its classes
with `@register_operation` when it is imported.

The server imports `engine.operations.sample_ops`, which runs this file first, so a running
server knows every operation without listing them itself. A new operation module is added to
`MODULES` below; tests/engine/test_operations_package.py fails if one is missing.

Importing an operation module only defines and registers classes: no backend, no hardware,
no file is touched until the runner starts an operation.
