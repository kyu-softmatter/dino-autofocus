"""`light_set{mode, line, percent}`: switch the light by meaning, nothing moves (ui-spec 4.3, D15).

Modes (ui-spec 7.2 "Brightfield on" / "Aura <line> <pct> % on"):

- `brightfield`: Aura off, DiaLamp on (`lamp_on`).
- `aura`: DiaLamp off, the Aura line at `percent` % (per-mille inside the backend), master on.
- `off`: everything off (`all_off`). The pre-emptive stop is the runner's `lights_off` command
  kind; this mode is the same switch-off asked for as a setting.

Allow-list: the four Aura lines and the DiaLamp, through the backend's meaning-level methods
only, never `set_property`. Every switch is read back; a readback that does not verify switches
everything off again and the operation ends in `error`. On success the light stays as set
(the runner's `keep_lights_on_finish`); every other exit path switches off.

Who may run it (D15: M3, operator with the control grant, open session) is the runner's
permission table (`light_set` is a light action there), not this module.

Light-on takes the control token (T-015), which only `engine.guards` may hold, so `switch`
goes through the operation scope's helpers `OpScope.lamp_on()` / `OpScope.aura_line_on()`
(T-002-4). They record the readback (`light_changed`) and raise GuardError when it does not
verify. Switching off needs no token.
