"""Thin wrapper: frozen-DINO focus reading -> ``FocusVerdict``.

``dino_autofocus.live`` (and with it torch) is imported only when a scorer is built from a
head file, so importing ``dino_autofocus.focus`` stays torch-free. The model's dz and sigma
end up in the verdict's evidence with grade ``"model"``; the verdict's z is the encoder
readback the caller passes for the frame.
