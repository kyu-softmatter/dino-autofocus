"""The audit log ``audit.jsonl``: who did what and when (X4).

One JSON object per line, **append only**. There is no API that edits or deletes a line.
Every line carries ``ts`` (UTC ISO 8601), ``kind``, ``user_id`` (account email, or null) and
``session_id`` (experiment session id, or null; T-019 supplies it through
``session_id_provider``), then the event's own fields.

Secrets never go in: a field whose name contains ``password`` or ``token`` is refused.
Writes are serialised by a lock, so threads may share one ``AuditLog``.
