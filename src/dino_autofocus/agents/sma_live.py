"""Switch a soft-matter-agents live view on from the console (its card 062, plan.md 11-25).

The person decided on 2026-10-07 that a live camera view is switched on and off from the
console, outside a plan too, because it helps find the sample. On the soft-matter-agents side
a live view is an ordinary preparatory run: the person starts a live-view host, and the host
runs a live-view command list the person wrote and approved in `<seat>_agent/approvals/`.
The console can only name such a list by its sha256. It cannot send a list, a path or a value.

What this module speaks (proposed by the console and agreed by the microscope seat for
card 062 on 2026-10-07):

- The host's address is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\soft-matter-agents\\live_host.json`, outside the
  soft-matter-agents tree, written atomically by the host while it runs and deleted when it
  stops: `{"host": "127.0.0.1", "port": N, "pid": P, "started_at": "<iso>"}`. Only 127.0.0.1
  is accepted. A missing file or a port that does not answer means the host is not running
  (a file left by a crash reads that way). `--live-host 127.0.0.1:N` is the manual fallback.
- A list is a file `live-view-<name>.json` in `<seat>_agent/approvals/` with `"card":
  "live_view_list"` (LIST_CARD; the one string expected to change when manager-microscope
  adds the schema). Its sha256 is of the raw file bytes, as for approved_commands. The host
  checks the list itself and does not trust what the console offers.
- "Live on": exactly one line, `{"live_on": "<sha256>"}`. Reply, one line:
  `{"live_on": "started", "run_id": "<id>"}`, sent once `run_started` is in that run's
  events.jsonl, or `{"live_on": "refused", "reason": "<text>"}` (the host records every
  refusal). A close with no reply means the host died mid-request: shown as refused, no reason.
- The run is then followed like any run (`sma_run`), and "Live off" is that run's own stop
  channel (`sma_run.send_stop`). There is no other way to stop it. It also ends by itself at
  the frame ceiling the person wrote in the list, so a forgotten live view stops.

Nothing here opens a camera or a device, or writes in the soft-matter-agents tree.
