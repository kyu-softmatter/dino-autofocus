"""The step rules of the focus drive, the XY stage and the PFS as pure functions (D-01).

These are the comparisons dino-autofocus's guards (``dino_autofocus.engine.guards``) make
before and after every move, with every limit as an argument and no number of its own:
the Z window, the retract and return heights, the readback tolerances, the per-lens free
working distances, long-move thresholds and approach steps all come from the caller. In
this repository the guards hold them (unmeasured provisional); in soft-matter-agents the
envelope the person writes and the plan the person approves hold them, and the operator or
the orchestrator calls these functions at the moment of comparison.

A rule returns ``None`` when the move is allowed and a sentence saying why when it is not;
nothing here moves anything, reads anything or holds state. Ambiguity refuses: an unknown
PFS state, an unknown lens and a model-graded number are all refusals, never defaults.

The rules, as the bench runs them (docs/runs/2026-09-30_substrate-scan.md, PLAN section 5):

- Z targets stay inside the sample window; below it only a park (descend only) may go.
- A move up is refused unless the caller allows that much ascent; sweeps are planned
  ascending in steps of at most the plan step and climb one step at a time.
- Every move is read back; off by more than the tolerance stops the operation.
- Coming back from a retract, Z does not jump to the target: one move to the window's
  return height, then steps of at most the lens's approach step, each one read back,
  rising, and passing the caller's clearance check.
- A sweep's ceiling is the window top or centre + fraction x free working distance,
  whichever is lower; a lens released from the immersion rule (Q4: dry lenses) has no lens
  ceiling and the window top binds; a lens with no known working distance gets no plan.
- An XY move longer than the lens's long-move threshold needs Z retracted first, unless the
  lens is released from that rule (dry); an unknown lens gets the strictest row.
- The nosepiece turns only with Z retracted, the PFS off and out of range.
- A model-graded value drives no motion.
