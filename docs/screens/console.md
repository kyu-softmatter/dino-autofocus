# Console screen contract (T-100 stage A)

Area `console` (PLAN.md 2절 F1, 9절 WP-F). This is the contract between the screen, the server router
`server/api/console.py` and the AgentStore. The panels themselves are in `docs/ui-spec.md` 7.1, which is
not repeated here (on main since T-004 merged).

Sources read: AgentStore `agents/store.py` (T-008, `exec6/T-008-agent-store` 28eaec8), server skeleton
`server/app.py` and `server/api/__init__.py` (T-009, `exec7/T-009-server-skeleton` a4e3671), roles and
control `auth/roles.py`, `auth/control.py` (T-018, in progress in exec13), web shell `web/README.md`
and `src/app/route.ts` (T-010 a5fb986, in review).

## Endpoints

All are mounted at `/api/console` by T-009's area-router mechanism. Bodies are the store dataclasses'
`to_dict()` output wrapped in pydantic models, so the OpenAPI types reach `web/src/api/`. Card contents
(`Card.data`, `RunDetail.records`, `InboxThread.status`) stay `Any` and pass through untouched; grades and
`numbers` are never re-computed (PLAN 6절 3항, ui-spec 7.1 "숫자 표").

| Method, path | Query / body | Response | AgentStore |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /store` | | `{store, writable}`: `"mock"` / `"soft-matter-agents"` (see "Rules") | store kind, `store.writable` |
| `GET /questions` | `agent=microscope\|simulation`, optional. Omitted: both, merged newest first | `QuestionSummary[]` | `list_questions(agent)`, once per agent |
| `GET /questions/{qid}` | `version=N`, optional. Omitted: latest | `QuestionDetail` (`summary.versions` lists the others) | `get_question(qid, version)` |
| `GET /runs` | `agent=`, optional, as for questions | `RunSummary[]` | `list_runs(agent)` |
| `GET /runs/{agent}/{run_id}` | | `RunDetail` (`not_opened` lists big or unreadable records) | `get_run(agent, run_id)` |
| `GET /runs/{agent}/{run_id}/stream` | `since=N` (the last answer's `total`) | `RunStream`: `followed`, `state` (`running` / `ended` / `not_followed`), `ended_how`, `can_stop`, `stop_unavailable` (words), `frame_tap`, `events[since:]`, `total` | `run_stream(agent, run_id)` (`agents/sma_run.py`) |
| `GET /runs/{agent}/{run_id}/frame` | | `image/jpeg` of the run's latest frame (binned, 0.5–99.5 percentile), metadata in `X-DinoAF-Frame`; 204 before the first frame | the run's frame tap |
| `POST /runs/{agent}/{run_id}/stop` | `{reason}` | `StopOut`: `outcome` `begun` / `refused` / `no_answer`, `message` | the run's stop channel |
| `GET /inbox` | | `InboxThread[]` with messages | `list_inbox()` |
| `GET /approvals` | `agent=`, optional | `Approval[]` (the seats' `approvals/` plan_approval cards, newest first; `plan_found`: a plan card of the question hashes to `plan_hash`) | `list_approvals(agent)` |
| `POST /questions` | `{text, target, purpose?, observable?}` | `201`, `QuestionSummary` | `submit_question(text, target, purpose=, observable=)` |

Error mapping (all T-009b refusals: `detail = {code, message}` and the `X-DinoAF-Refusal` header):
`NotFoundError` → 404 `not_found`; empty text or an unknown `purpose` (`ValueError`) → 422 `invalid`
(a bad `agent` / `target` is FastAPI's own 422); a read-only store → 409 `read_only_store` with
`"Submitting to soft-matter-agents is not connected yet (read-only)"`; other `StoreError` → 500
`store_error`.

Versions: the picker lists every entry of `summary.versions` as the store returns it (1 for unprefixed
files, N for any `vN_` prefix; v4_, v5_ exist). The screen assumes no upper bound and no fixed set, unlike
the `r1`/`v2_`/`v3_` example in ui-spec 7.1.

The status and date filters and the two-version diff (ui-spec 7.1) run in the browser over these
responses: the list is small, and the diff fetches `?version=` twice. No server diff endpoint.

Refresh: when the area opens and on the `"Refresh"` button. No polling, no file watching (ui-spec 7.1).
After a successful submit the screen re-reads `GET /questions`. One exception: a running followed run
(below) is read again every second until it ends.

## A run soft-matter-agents executes (C-04, C-08)

soft-matter-agents plan.md 11-25: a run its orchestrator follows writes `runs/<run_id>/events.jsonl`
(`run_started` … `run_ended` with `how` = completed, aborted_by_monitor, stopped_from_outside or failed),
announces a loopback stop channel and a frame tap in `run_started`, and keeps going if a viewer drops.

- The run list shows such a run by its stream while it has no `log.json`: outcome `running`, then `how`.
- A microscope run's detail starts with a "Followed run" box: state, the events so far, the latest
  frame (only while the run's own acquisition produces frames; the tap never snaps and the console
  opens no camera, OD-13), and `"Abort this run"` with an optional reason.
- Abort sends one line on the run's own stop channel; the run calls the same abort() as its other stop
  paths and records `stop_requested` with the reason and who pressed it. The server treats it as a stop:
  the microscope PC always, a logged-in remote viewer when remote abort is on (D13), otherwise 403.
  The answer is shown next to the button: began to abort / refused (the run records why) / no answer
  in 15 s (watch the events).
- `"Closing this page does not stop the run."` (OD-30): nothing sends a stop except the button.
- An ended run: the button is disabled with `"the run has ended (<how>)"`. A run without events.jsonl:
  no button, and `"Abort: this run is not followed (no events.jsonl), so the console has no stop channel
  for it; stop it at the instrument or in the operator terminal"`. Simulation runs have no Abort here.
- Nothing is written in the soft-matter-agents tree (the audit line goes to the console's own folder).

## Microscope live view from the console (C-15, soft-matter-agents card 062)

The person decided on 2026-10-07 that a live camera view is switched on and off from the console,
outside a plan too, to help find the sample. The Live area shows a "Microscope live view" bar:

- `GET /api/console/live`: whether soft-matter-agents' live-view host is running (its address file
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\soft-matter-agents\live_host.json`, or `--live-host-file` / `--live-host
  127.0.0.1:N`), and the live-view lists the person approved (`microscope_agent/approvals/
  live-view-*.json`, `"card": "live_view_list"`), each with the values the person wrote.
- `"Live on"`: `POST /api/console/live/on {sha256}`, an operator action on the microscope PC
  (`/api/permissions?ops=live_on`). The console names the list by its sha256 and nothing else; the
  host checks the list and starts an ordinary run, then the screen follows it (frames from its tap).
  A refusal is shown with the host's reason (`"a run holds the lock"`, ...).
- `"Live off"`: the run's own stop, `POST .../runs/microscope/{id}/stop`. The text says: `"Live off
  stops the run (lamp off, shutters closed). Closing this page does not stop it; it ends by itself
  at the frame ceiling."`
- Fluorescence is not in the default list; a list with any other light is the person's separate
  approval on the soft-matter-agents side. Nothing is written in that tree by the console.

## Which store (C-03)

`python -m dino_autofocus.server --store sma --sma-root DIR` (default root `$DINO_AF_SMA_ROOT`, else the
desktop checkout) shows the soft-matter-agents files themselves: questions, runs, inbox and approvals of
both seats, read only. A root with no seat folder stops the start-up with the reason. Without `--store`
the console shows the mock sample (`agents/mock_data`, pinned at baf6f1e). `GET /questions/{qid}` carries
`plan_hash` (sha256 of that version's plan card with `status` left out, as soft-matter-agents computes it)
and every approval naming the question; the screen says which plan each approval signs. JSON is read as
utf-8-sig. The console writes nothing in that tree: approvals are the person's, written outside it.

## Rules: remote, role, read-only

Reads (`GET`) are open to every logged-in user, local or remote, any role (ui-spec 7.0 remote table).

Submit is refused in this order; the first reason is the one shown (ui-spec 7.0 "비활성 이유"):

Before anyone clicks, the screen asks the shared `GET /api/permissions?ops=submit_question` (T-009b, backed
by T-011's check and T-018's `SUBMIT_QUESTION` plus loopback) and shows its `reason` as written. The console
router computes no role, control, session or remote rule itself; it adds only its own rule, the read-only
store, through `GET /api/console/store`. Reason order on screen: the shell's read-only flag (`useReadOnly`,
`"Read-only: remote view"`), then the permission reason (`"Checking permissions…"` while loading,
`"Permission check unavailable"` on error or a missing op), then the store's. Reads go through the shell's
client (`useClient().get`); the screen re-reads when the event socket reconnects after a drop.

| Check | Where | Status on submit | Screen text |
|---|---|---|---|
| Request is not from the microscope PC | the shell's read-only flag; the access middleware on the POST | 403 `remote_view` | `"Read-only: remote view"` |
| Not logged in, screen locked | `/api/permissions`; the access middleware | 401 `login_required`, 423 `locked` | the permission reason |
| Role below operator (viewer), D16 | `/api/permissions`; `server_action_why(me, "submit_question")` in the route | 403 `role` | the permission reason, shown next to the form |
| Store is not the mock store | `/api/console/store`; `store.writable` in the route | 409 `read_only_store` | `"Submitting to soft-matter-agents is not connected yet (read-only)"` |

- "Mock store only" is enforced through `AgentStore.writable`, not `isinstance(store, MockStore)`. This is
  deliberate: T-025 added `writable` (gap 1) so routes need not test the class. Today `MockStore` is the
  only writable store and `SmaFiles` is False. A real soft-matter-agents writer, if one is ever added
  (integration, PLAN 10절 F1.1), must also change the 409 rule here and the ui-spec 7.1 text.

- D16: the POST route calls `server_action_why` (T-018 `SUBMIT_QUESTION` plus loopback) on the server.
  Disabling the button is only the display of the permission answer. Device control (the control token)
  is not needed: submitting moves nothing. An open experiment session is not needed either (PLAN 6절 12항
  covers commands that move hardware).
- The web submit goes through the shell's `client.post`: only a 403 `remote_view` switches the app to
  read-only; every other refusal is shown next to the form and changes no global state.
- An accepted submit goes to the audit log as `question_submitted` with `user_id`, `session_id` (the open
  experiment session, else null), `origin: "console"`, `target` and the new `qid` (PLAN 5절 "로그 세 가지").
  Refusals are not logged by this route: the audit kinds have none for a refused question.

## Prompt context (X1)

The screen calls the shell's `useScreenContext(details)` (`src/app/screenContext`, T-010 `web/README.md`);
the prompt box (T-014) only reads it. Details: selected `qid`, `version`, selected card `kind`
(`goal`, `axis`, `plan`, `synthesis`, `refusal`, ...), selected `run_id` and its `agent`. Short ids only;
no card bodies and no images (D7).

## Links out

- Simulation run detail → the T-012 simulation area for progress, trajectory and download (gap 6).
- "이 저장소의 실험" panel (samples and experiment sessions) → `sample` and `sessions` areas. Not served
  by AgentStore; stage B shows links only (gap 5).

## Gaps (requests)

1. ~~T-008~~: closed, `AgentStore.writable` (T-025).
2. ~~T-009~~: closed, `create_app(agent_store=...)` and `AgentStoreDep`.
3. ~~T-009 / T-018~~: closed, `Login`, `IsLocal`, `server_action_why` (T-009b).
4. ~~T-018~~: closed, `AuditKind.QUESTION_SUBMITTED` covers the console submit and prompt boxes. There is
   no kind for a refused question, so refusals are not logged here.
5. **T-019 / sample**: the "이 저장소의 실험" list has no read API yet; stage B links out only.
6. ~~T-010 / T-012~~: closed. The link is `#/simulation/runs/<run_id>`; the shell passes `#/<area>/<rest>`
   through (no link helper) and T-012 stage 2 reads the suffix.
7. ~~T-014~~: resolved by the shell's `useScreenContext` (T-010); nothing waits on T-014.
8. **T-008 / T-025, store**: ui-spec 7.1 list columns that the summaries do not carry: `purpose`, `intent`,
   `observable.name` of the latest goal (`QuestionSummary`), and `approval.kind` of the log (`RunSummary`).
   Closed: T-025 sends `purpose`, `intent`, `observable_name`, `approval_kind`; the lists show them ("—"
   when a card has none).

Web types: the router's models and `PermissionOut` are not in the committed `web/src/api/schema.ts` yet, so
`features/console/api.ts` keeps hand copies until T-010 regenerates it after this router merges.
